How to Open and Explore the Dashboard
To view or interact with the dashboard, you need Tableau Desktop installed on your machine.

Steps:
Download the .twbx file from this repository.

Open Tableau Desktop.

Go to File > Open, and select the downloaded .twbx file.

The dashboard will load with all data embeddedâ€”no need to reconnect to a separate data source.

You can now explore, edit, or customize the visualizations freely.

Note: This file is a Tableau Packaged Workbook (.twbx), which includes the data and visualizations in one file for easy sharing.
